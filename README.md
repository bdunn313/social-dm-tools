# Social DM Tools

A tool for dungeon masters to socialize the campaign experience. The first planned feature 
is to allow for you and your players to collaborate on random roll tables.

This is also an effort for me as a programmer to experiment with [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) 
and [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/en/) as a technology and see what it
 is like to use it in a practical project that interfaces with a ([Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/)) server.
